# The depth audit

The curriculum's job is not to be wide. It is to make a reader able to
*operate* a production system — which means the curriculum has to show the
failure modes that production systems actually hit, and the fix that each one
exists to serve. A "deep detail" in any real system is almost always a
solution to a failure mode: sparse labels, delayed feedback, cold start, a
leaky split, a cascade that disagrees with its own ranker, dirty training
data. When a chapter only names the mechanism and skips the failure mode, the
reader learns a vocabulary, not a system.

This document is the standing audit program for that depth. It is a queue,
not a one-time pass: sections are audited one at a time, in the order below,
and each audit must satisfy the contract before it is marked done.

## The audit contract

An audited section must, for each stage it covers, do all of the following:

1. **Name the failure mode before the fix.** The chapter opens with the
   operational symptom (a metric that drifts, a label that lies, a rank that
   disagrees with the page) and the cost of ignoring it.
2. **Show how you find the case.** Distribution checks, per-stage offline
   consistency, sampling, stratification, case triage — the reader learns
   where the failure shows up, not just what it is.
3. **Show the fix and what it trades.** Every fix has a cost: more labels vs
   freshness, calibration vs ranking, exploration vs exploitation. The chapter
   measures the trade with a run.
4. **Cover the whole production loop, not the model alone.** For every stage
   that touches them: model detail, sample construction, data pipeline,
   feature engineering, API and engineering implementation, product alignment,
   and the cross-team handoff (who owns the label, who owns the cut, who owns
   the traffic).
5. **Never write from memory.** Research and industry practice must be
   integrated, attributed, and dated. If a claim is not in a `runs/` record or
   a cited source, it does not go in. Estimates and "typical" values are
   failures here.
6. **Serve the interview goal.** The section must leave the reader able to
   answer the operational version of the question: what breaks, how do you
   find it, what do you do, how do you know it worked.

## The failure-mode canvas

Every domain gets a canvas that names its failure modes, the pipeline stage
that owns each one, and the technique class that addresses it. The canvas is
not the lesson; it is the checklist an auditor runs against the section.

| Domain | Failure mode | Stage that owns it | Technique class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recommendation | Sparse labels | sample construction, label generation | entire-space funnel, multi-task, label smoothing |
| Recommendation | Delayed feedback | label window, freshness | windowing, fake-negative correction, survival-style weighting |
| Recommendation | Exposure bias | data collection, logging | IPS, propensity estimation, exploration traffic |
| Recommendation | Cold start | retrieval, features | content embeddings, warm-start priors |
| Recommendation | Heavy-tail targets | objective, loss | log/quantile objectives, gradient balancing |
| Recommendation | Funnel inconsistency | model family, serving | probability-constrained heads, stage-consistent training |
| Recommendation | Cascade inconsistency | pre-rank, rank, serving | distillation that preserves top-k, cut-aware training |
| Any ranking | Sample split leakage | evaluation | user/query-cluster splits, as-of joins |
| Any ranking | A/B traffic split | experimentation | SRM checks, unit of randomization, carryover |
| Any ranking | Offline/online divergence | evaluation, serving | replay, interleaving, consistency monitoring |
| LLM | Dirty training data | data engineering | dedup, quality filters, contamination checks |
| LLM | Format conflicts (pre-train vs post-train) | data engineering | neutral separators, chat-template masking |
| LLM | Delayed/poisoned reward | RL data | reward modeling, human-feedback loops, gaming checks |
| Agentic | Tool-result failure recovery | trace construction | noise injection, error-recovery trajectories |
| Agentic | Sparse agentic data | data engineering | notebook/trace mining, synthetic tool-use |
| Multimodal | Modality imbalance | sample construction | per-modality sampling, codebook collapse checks |
| Serving | Latency vs quality | serving | cascade cuts, pre-rank budgets, cache placement |

## The audit queue

Each entry names the section, the stage range, and the status. A section is
`pending`, `in progress`, or `done`; `done` means every stage in it satisfies
the audit contract above.

### Personalized discovery — recommendation 56-63

**Status: done (first audit increment, 2026-08-07).**

Failure modes audited with measured runs: entire-space funnel (CTCVR under
sparse CTR), delayed feedback (freshness vs correctness, window size),
negative sampling (calibration vs ranking, ratio misestimation, extreme
negative rates), exposure bias (IPS vs naive, thin exploration traffic, noisy
propensity), heavy-tail objectives (AOV skew, whale dominance), multi-task
conflict (gradient balancing, gating, dominant-task drift), funnel consistency
(impossible probabilities, constraint cost, order vs click), cascade
consistency (pre-rank vs final ranker, distillation blur, top-k preservation).

### Personalized discovery — shared 00-09 (retrieval to report)

**Status: pending.**

Audit the cascade stages against the canvas: split leakage, serving latency,
staleness, calibration gates, value trees, rule-engine interaction, and the
report guardrails. Add the A/B experiment chapter that does not yet exist
(sample split, unit of randomization, SRM, carryover, guardrail metrics).

### Personalized discovery — shared 43-55 (operations)

**Status: pending.**

Audit feature store, training-serving consistency, feedback loops,
retraining/staleness, monitoring and drift, realtime user state, throughput,
cost per query, new-user experience, trust/explainability, fairness,
LTV/CAC. Every chapter needs the distribution and offline-consistency checks
per stage, and at least one failure-mode run.

### Personalized discovery — search 10-24, 35-37

**Status: pending.**

Audit query understanding, retrieval, ranking, evaluation, expansion, dense
retrieval, fusion, reranking, personalization, measurement, generative
retrieval, conversational search, LLM query understanding. Each needs the
label-construction and offline-consistency detail the recommendation track now
has.

### Personalized discovery — ads 14-18, 25-30, 38-42, 54

**Status: pending.**

Audit auction, eCPM ranking, calibration, pacing, externality, frequency
capping, creative selection, bid strategy, auction revenue, RTB pipeline, ads
measurement, interleaving, first-price transition, privacy-safe attribution,
LLM creative generation, marketplace economics, advertiser ROAS. Ads is where
the A/B and traffic-split detail belongs most.

### Personalized discovery — recommendation 31-34 (frontier)

**Status: pending.**

Audit LLM ranking, recommendation RLHF, multimodal recall, slate evaluation.
Add the offline-consistency and reward-gaming depth that the 56-63 audit
established as the standard.

### Language-model system — 00-07

**Status: pending.**

Audit the LLM track with the same lens: dirty data and washing (dedup,
quality filters, contamination), tokenizer edge cases, pretraining data mix
(sample, RL, SFT, agentic data and how each enters pretraining), format
conflicts between pre-train and post-train, distillation failure modes, RL
reward gaming, eval gates, and serving/cascade latency. The model-processing
and sample-construction detail the user asks for lives here.

### Foundations, infra-absorbed chapters, and remaining missions

**Status: pending.**

Audit foundations for the failure-mode lens (optimization plateaus, dead
experts, significance under multiple testing), the multimodal generation
track (codebook collapse, modality imbalance, streaming decode), quantitative
research (as-of joins, restatements, purge), agentic platform (tool-result
recovery), game AI (policy collapse, closed-loop divergence), bio-pharma
modeling, and autonomous driving (perception failure, distribution shift,
closed-loop evaluation).

## How an audit is marked done

An audit is done when every stage in the section:

- has a chapter whose opening question is an operational symptom, not a
  mechanism;
- has a `runs/` record with real measured numbers for the fix and its cost;
- names the pipeline stage that owns the failure mode and the cross-team
  handoff;
- cites the research and industry practice it relies on, dated;
- is reachable from the sidebar and named by at least one topic in
  `site/topics.mdx`.

The queue is worked in order, one section at a time, and a section is never
half-audited: it stays `in progress` until the whole stage range passes.
